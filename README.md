In this project, the mobile robot was designed by using various sensors and modules. The discovery robot, which can be controlled from the web interface designed as a user control panel, acts in accordance with the data coming from the user. There is also an obstacle avoiding autonomous robot mode.

Thanks to the ultrasonic distance sensor mounted on it, it can detect the obstacles in front of it, can detect the temperature and humidity value of the environment with the help of the heat and humidity sensor, and can transmit the image of the environment to the user simultaneously with the help of its camera from the control panel, thus allowing the user to get more detailed information about the robot's environment. It is aimed to design a reconnaissance robot that allows them to have information. In addition, the creation of an open source to create a mobile robot for education and research is one of the foundations of this purpose.
